# ðŸš€ Introduction

### <mark style="color:orange;">What's Gamekube ?</mark>

Gamekube is a DeFi platform that allows to buy, rent and sell specific assets such as [scholars](fundamentals/games-gamers-guilds.md#scholar), it's gamers that plays Play To Earn (PTE) games and share their earnings.

It will also be a full DeFI app that make the acquisition of this kind of assets easier.

And lastly it will allows for pro players to create the NFT avatars as sponsorshiping for their E-sport carreers.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Why Gamekube ?</mark>

By creating [shintogo](https://www.shintogo.com), a [scholarship ](fundamentals/games-gamers-guilds.md#guild)in early 2021, we've realised two things :&#x20;

* There are many players who want to parcipate in Play-To-Earn games but without the possibility to fill entry price.
* On the other hand there's many crypto investors who wan't to acquire NFTs and players but there's no easy DeFi app to do it.

This is where Gamekube is born

### <mark style="color:orange;">How it will work?</mark>

The app will be really easy and straitforward, it will allow to buy a scholar, we will create NFT's in order to give to the investor a proof of possession, it will be a conbinaison of the player, the guild that he's in and the game.

We will also allows pro players to create their own NFT and share their potential revenues.

Lastly we will have DeFi features such as Liquitidy Pools and other future features that we will reveal later.
